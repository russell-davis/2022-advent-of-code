# 2022 Advent of code

## What is this?
This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. 

I'm using this as a way to learn a new framework, and to get better at programming in general. I'm using the  [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` [(GitHub 
repository)](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app). Links to all the major technologies used are below.
